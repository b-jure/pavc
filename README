ABOUT
pavc short for PulseAudio volume control is a cli tool used to interface
with the PulseAudio (sound server).
As the name itself suggests pavc primarily controls sink device volume levels
but it can also run other commands on them.


USAGE
- pavc                    (displays usage)
- pavc up 10              (this increases the sink device volume by 10%)
- pavc down 10            (this decreases the sink device volume by 10%)
- pavc toggle             (toggles mute, if already muted then unmute)
- pavc volume percent     (displays the current volume level of sink device as percentage)
- pavc volume decibel     (displays the current volume level of sink device in decibels)

You can also run commands on specific sink device:
- pavc up 10 "my_sink_device_name"	(increases "my_sink_device_name" volume by 10%)
this applies for all the other commands also.
